    "Create a base class Transport with a method travel() that prints a generic travel message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create three subclasses: Bus – Represents intercity travel (e.g., Daewoo Express) Train – Represents railway travel (e.g., Pakistan Railways) Airplane – Represents air travel (e.g., PIA – Pakistan International Airlines)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each subclass should override the travel() method to display unique travel details like the mode of transport, speed, and common use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function plan_trip(transport) that accepts an object of type Transport and calls its travel() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create objects of all three subclasses and pass them to the plan_trip() function to demonstrate Polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different subclasses (Bus, Train, Airplane) to be treated as objects of a common superclass (Transport). Each subclass provides a specific implementation of the travel() method. The function plan_trip() ensures that the correct version of the method is executed, even though it does not know the exact subclass beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "Qasim plans a trip from Lahore to Karachi.\n",
    "\n",
    "If he travels by Daewoo Bus, the travel() method displays details about bus travel, like travel time and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "If he chooses Pakistan Railways Train, the method provides information about train schedules and cabins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If he selects PIA Airplane, the method highlights flight duration, security checks, and ticket prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan_trip() function ensures that Ali gets the correct travel details, regardless of whether he chooses a bus, train, or airplane."
